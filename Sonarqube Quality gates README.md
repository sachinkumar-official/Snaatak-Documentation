# SonarQube Quality Gates Documentation

---

## Introduction

This documentation provides a simple and practical guide about SonarQube Quality Gates: what they are, why you need them, how they work, and how to use them effectively.

---

## What are SonarQube Quality Gates?

Quality Gates are simple rules in SonarQube that check your code for problems like bugs, security issues, and bad practices before the code moves forward.

---

## Why Use Quality Gates?

Quality Gates help you catch issues early, make code safer, and keep your project healthy by stopping bad code from being released.

## Identification of Quality Gates

Quality Gates are like traffic lights for your code. They tell you if your code is good to go or if it needs fixing.

- **Default Quality Gate:**  
  SonarQube comes with a ready-to-use Quality Gate called "Sonar way." It checks for basic things like no new serious bugs, high enough test coverage, and not too much duplicated code.

- **Custom Quality Gates:**  
  You can make your own Quality Gates if the default one doesn’t fit your needs. For example, you can set stricter rules or add new checks depending on your project.

**How to find Quality Gates in SonarQube:**
1. Log in to SonarQube.
2. Click on "Quality Gates" in the main menu.
3. Here, you can see the list of all gates, what they check, and which projects use them.

## Best Practices

| Best Practice                 | Description                                                    |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Start Simple                  | Use the default gate first, then adjust as needed.             |
| Focus on New Code             | Apply gates to new code to avoid legacy issues.                |
| Review Regularly              | Check and update gates to match team goals.                    |
| Integrate with CI/CD          | Block merges/deploys if the gate fails.                        |
| Educate Your Team             | Make sure everyone understands the Quality Gate rules.          |
