# BuildPiper Documentation

## Introduction
This documentation provides a simple and practical guide about BuildPiper's CI orchestration tools, which automate building, testing, and deploying code while streamlining microservices delivery.

## What is BuildPiper?
BuildPiper is an engineering productivity platform crafted by OpsTree Labs supporting end-to-end application delivery from code commit to production, microservices onboarding, and fully automated CI/CD pipelines. Its orchestration engine manages the flow of code from source control to production—coordinating build, test, packaging, and deployment—while offering easy setup, configuration, and monitoring of scalable, efficient pipelines for modern teams.

## Why Use BuildPiper?
Traditional CI/CD tools often require extensive scripting, fragmented security practices, and manual scaling. BuildPiper provides a standardized, DevSecOps-ready, Kubernetes-native solution, reducing operational overhead and technical debt while enabling:
- Faster Time-to-Market: Up to 70% reduction in deployment cycles.

- Greater Productivity: Automated workflows save 10+ developer hours/week.

- Lower Infrastructure Cost: Real-time observability drives 30% savings.

- Process Compliance: Embedded gates and customizable checks ensure 98%+ compliance.

- High Scalability and Reliability: Auto-scaling agents handle variable loads.
