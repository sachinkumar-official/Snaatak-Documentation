# Introduction

 This document will walk you through the step-by-step process of installing GitHub, an essential platform for version control and collaborative software development. GitHub is a web-based 
 platform and version control system that plays a crucial role in modern software development. It provides a collaborative environment for developers to host, manage, and share their code 
 repositories.

## 4. Team Management

Teams help organize contributors and manage permissions.

### Step 1: Create Teams

- Go to your organization > **Teams** > **New team**.

### Step 2: Assign Repository Access

- Assign teams to repositories.
- Set permissions (read, write, admin) based on role.
- Example: Developers get write access, Testers get read access.

## 5. Version Control Concepts

### Centralized VCS

- One central repository; all changes are committed to this server.
- Example tools: SVN, Perforce.

### Distributed VCS (Git/GitHub)

- Everyone has a local copy of the repository.
- Changes are made locally, then pushed to the remote repository.
- Collaboration is enhanced; no single point of failure.

### Local VCS

- Tracks changes only on your local machine.
- Not recommended for team projects.

### Setting Up Git Locally
